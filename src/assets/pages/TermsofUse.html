<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p>Welcome to DealsBargain. The DealsBargain.com website, DealsBargain 
 mobile and iPad apps, and our mobile DealsBargain site are collectively 
 the “DealsBargain Properties” and each individually is a “DealsBargain 
 Property.” By using any DealsBargain Property and its related services, 
 products, and software, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions 
 (“Terms”). You also accept the Terms when you create an account, make 
 a purchase as a guest, or log in to any DealsBargain Property. We may 
 make changes to any DealsBargain Property and the Terms. It is your responsibility 
 to review the Terms for updates or changes. If you do not agree with the 
 Terms, you should not use the DealsBargain Properties.</p>

<h5>Information on Our Site</h5>
<p>We try to be as accurate as possible with the information we present 
 on the DealsBargain Properties. We will make reasonable efforts to accurately 
 display the attributes of the products we sell. We do not warrant that 
 product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete, or error 
 free. Prices and promotions are subject to change, and may vary from those 
 offered in our stores. We cannot confirm the availability or price of 
 an item until you place your order. Despite our best efforts, sometimes 
 an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer may have been misstated, 
 or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your 
 order or we may contact you for instructions on the order.</p>
<h5>Paying for Your Order</h5>
<p>Generally, we’ll charge your payment method for an item when we ship 
 the item to you or confirm its availability in store. However, we may 
 preauthorize your order amount with your credit card, credit account, 
 or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an 
 effect on your available credit line. When you pre-order with a debit 
 card, we’ll debit your card when you place the pre-order. For special 
 delivery items, we’ll charge your payment method when you confirm a delivery 
 time. For digital items, we’ll charge your payment method when you initiate 
 the download of the product or the product is placed in your account and 
 available for use.</p>
<h5>Order Confirmation</h5>
<p>Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your 
 order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any 
 time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity 
 or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits 
 on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, 
 limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using 
 the e-mail address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or part of 
 an order that we’ve already charged you for, we’ll refund you the full 
 amount of the cancelled portion of the order.</p>

<h5>Dispute Resolution by Binding Individual Arbitration</h5>
<p>ANY DISPUTE INVOLVING YOU AND DEALSBARGAIN OR ANY OF ITS AGENTS SHALL 
 BE RESOLVED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED 
 BELOW.</p>
<p>“Dispute” shall be interpreted broadly and include any claim or controversy 
 arising out of or relating in any way to your relationship with DealsBargain 
 and its subsidiaries, affiliates, and designees &#160;whether based in 
 contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. 
 This includes (1) In-Home Consultations; (2) use of DealsBargain websites; 
 (3) any service terms and conditions; and/or (4) any products or services 
 offered, sold, or distributed by DealsBargain including, but not limited 
 to, the advertising of or the sales practices for such products and services. 
 </p>
<p>BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATION, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE WAIVING 
 YOUR RIGHT TO MAINTAIN OTHER AVAILABLE RESOLUTION PROCESSES, SUCH AS A 
 COURT ACTION OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING, TO SETTLE DISPUTES. THE RULES 
 IN ARBITRATION ARE DIFFERENT. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, LESS DISCOVERY, 
 AND LIMITED APPELLATE REVIEW. ARBITRATORS CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND 
 RELIEF THAT A COURT CAN AWARD.</p>
<p>Either Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding by sending a demand 
 to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) that describes the basis 
 for the claim. You may serve a copy of a demand on our registered agent 
 CT Corporation System, Inc., 100 South Fifth Street, Suite 1075, Minneapolis, 
 MN 55402. The arbitration will be governed by the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration 
 Rules or Commercial Arbitration Rules (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), 
 as appropriate, and as modified by these Terms, and will be administered 
 by the AAA. The AAA Rules and the form for filing an arbitration claim 
 are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of 
 all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the 
 AAA’s rules, however we will reimburse those fees (but not any attorney’s 
 fees) for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines 
 your claims are frivolous. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance 
 of your claim or the relief sought in your demand is frivolous or brought 
 for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal 
 Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will 
 be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse DealsBargain 
 for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation 
 to pay under the AAA Rules. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted 
 by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county 
 where you live or at another mutually agreed upon location. </p>
<p>YOU AND DEALSBARGAIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER 
 ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS 
 MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
 THIS MEANS THAT YOU MAY NOT PURPORT TO ACT ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OR ANY 
 OTHER PERSON. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief 
 only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent 
 necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. 
 The arbitrator may not award relief for or against anyone who is not a 
 party to the arbitration proceeding. Further, unless both you and DealsBargain 
 agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s 
 claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative 
 or class proceeding. If a court determines that public injunctive relief 
 may not be waived and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted, 
 then the parties agree that any claim for public injunctive relief shall 
 be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. If this specific 
 paragraph is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this dispute 
 resolution provision (except for the jury trial waiver) shall be null 
 and void.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, ANY DISPUTE THAT FALLS WITHIN 
 THE JURISDICTIONAL SCOPE AND AMOUNT OF AN APPROPRIATE SMALL CLAIMS COURT 
 SHALL BE BROUGHT IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN ADDITION, 
 EITHER PARTY MAY ELECT TO BRING AN ACTION IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION 
 TO SEEK TO ENJOIN INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER MISUSE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 RIGHTS.</p>
<p>If for any reason a claim may proceed in court rather than in arbitration, 
 we each waive any right to a jury trial, unless such waiver is unenforceable. 
 This means that any claim would be decided by a judge, not a jury.</p>
<p>This dispute resolution section shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration 
 Act. It shall survive any termination or cancellation of, or your participation 
 in, the Program. Any amendments to this dispute resolution section shall 
 be prospective only and shall not affect any pending arbitration proceeding.</p>
<h5>Applicable Law</h5>
<p>THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AND APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW (OR IN THE ABSENCE 
 OF APPLICABLE FEDERAL LAW, THEN THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA), WITHOUT 
 REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS, WILL GOVERN THESE TERMS AND 
 APPLY TO ANY DISPUTES AGAINST DEALSBARGAIN.</p>
<h5>Termination of Use</h5>
<p>We may, in our sole discretion, terminate your account or your use of 
 the DealsBargain Properties at any time. You are personally liable for 
 any orders that you place or charges that you incur prior to termination. 
 We may change, suspend or discontinue all or any aspects of any DealsBargain 
 Property at any time without prior notice.</p>
